###Problem 1 (By hand): (10 points)

Consider the nonlinear equation
$$f(x)=x^2-2=0$$

(a) With $x_0 = 1$ as a starting point, what is the value of $x_1$ if you use Newton’s method for solving this problem?
$$f'(x)=2x$$
$$x_1=x_0-\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}=1+\frac{1}{2}=1.5$$


(b) With $x_0 = 1$ and $x_1 = 2$ as starting points, what is the value of $x_2$ if you use the secant method for the same problem?

$$x_2=x_1-f(x_1)(x_1-x_0)/(f(x_1)-f(x_0))=0$$

###Problem 2: (20 points)

For the equation
$$x^2 −3x+2=0$$
each of the following functions yields an equivalent fixed-point problem:
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
g_1(x)& = & (x^2+2)/3\\
g_2(x)& = & \sqrt{3x-2}\\
g_3(x)& = & 3-2/x\\
g_4(x)& = & (x^2-2)/(2x-3)
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

(a) Analyze the convergence properties of each of the corresponding fixed-point iteration schemes for the root $x = 2$ by considering $|g_i'(2)|$.

$|g_1'(2)| = 4/3 > 1$ it will not converge to 2
$|g_2'(2)|= 1/2 < 1$ it will converge, with rate 2
$|g_i'(2)| = 7/2 >1 $ it will not converge
$|g_i'(2)| = 0 $ it will converge quadratically.

(b) Confirm your analysis by implementing each of the schemes and verifying its convergence (or lack thereof) and approximate convergence rate.

The code is given below. It produce the graph of how the each function is approaching and how the error is changing.
```python

from math import sqrt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn
import numpy as np

def fixpoint(f, iter_times):
    x = [3.0]
    for i in range(iter_times):
        x.append(f(x[-1]))
    return np.array(x)

g1 = lambda x: (x*x+2)/3
g2 = lambda x: np.sqrt(3*x-2)
g3 = lambda x: 3-2/x
g4 = lambda x: (x*x-2)/(2*x-3)

def scatterplot(g, points):
    x = np.linspace(1.5, 3.0)
    plt.plot(x,x)
    plt.plot(x,g(x))
    plt.scatter(points[:-1], points[1:])
    plt.show()
    
def errorplot(points, value):
    plt.semilogy(np.arange(len(points)),np.abs(points-value))
    print np.abs(points-value)
    plt.show()

%matplotlib inline
for g in [g1, g2, g3, g4]:
	scatterplot(g1, fixpoint(g, 5))
	errorplot(fixpoint(g,10), 2)
```

###Problem 3: (15 points)

Bioremediation involves the use of bacteria to consume toxic wastes. At steady state, the bacterial density x and nutrient concentration y satisfy the system of nonlinear equations

$$\begin{eqnarray*}
\gamma xy − x(1 + y) & = & 0\\
−xy + (\delta − y)(1 + y) &= & 0
\end{eqnarray*}$$

where $\gamma$ and $\delta$ are parameters that depend on various physical features of the system; typical values are $\gamma = 5$ and $\delta = 1$. Implement Newton’s method for solving a system of nonlinear equations, and use your implementation to solve this system numerically. You should find at least one solution with a nonzero bacterial density ($x\ne 0$), and one in which the bacterial population has died out ($x = 0$). Clearly indicate your initial guesses and the solutions to which they converged in your writeup.

Plug in $\gamma$ and $\delta$, we get 
$$\begin{eqnarray}
 5xy − x(1 + y) & = & 0\\
−xy + (1 − y)(1 + y) &= & 0
\end{eqnarray}$$

The Jacobean then becomes:
$$J = \begin{bmatrix}
4y-1 & 4x\\
-y & -x-2y
\end{bmatrix}$$

Thus, the newton's method is coded as follow
``` python
import numpy.linalg as la

def F(xs):
    x,y = xs
    return np.array([5*x*y-x*(1+y), -x*y+(1-y)*(1+y)])

def J(xs):
    x,y = xs
    return np.array([[4*y-1, 4*x], [-y, -x-2*y]])

def newtons(F, J, xs):
    x = []
    y = []
    s = np.array([1,1])
    while la.norm(s)!=0:
        s = la.solve(J(xs), -F(xs))
        x.append(xs[0])
        y.append(xs[1])
        xs = xs+s
    x.append(xs[0])
    y.append(xs[1])
    plt.plot(x,y)
    return xs
        
i = 0      
print newtons(F, J, np.array([3, 2]))
print newtons(F, J, np.array([2, -3]))
print newtons(F, J, np.array([3, 0]))
```

### Problem 4: Optimization Theory (20 points)
(a) Determine the critical points of the function, $f(x) = 2x^3 − 25x^2 − 12x + 15$, and characterize each as a minimum, maximum, or inflection point. Also, determine whether the function has a global minimum or maximum on $\mathbb{R}$.

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{df}{dx} &=& 6x^2-50x-12\\
\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} &=& 12x-50
\end{eqnarray}$$

For $\dot{f} = 0$, $x = \frac{1}{6}(25 \pm \sqrt{697})$,
For $x_1 = \frac{1}{6}(25 + \sqrt{697})$, $\ddot{f}>0$, and $x_2 =\frac{1}{6}(25 - \sqrt{697})$ $\ddot{f}<0$

Thus $x_1$ is a local maximum and $x_2$ is a local minimum. And it does not have a global minimum or a maximum.

(b) Determine the critical points of the function, $f(x) = 2x^3 − 3x^2 − 6xy(x-y-1)$, and characterize each as a minimum, maximum, or inflection point. Also, determine whether the function has a global minimum or maximum on $\mathbb{R}$.

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &=& 6x^2+6y^2-12xy-6x+6y\\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &=& -6x^2+12xy+6x\\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} &=& 12x-12y-6\\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} &=& -12x-12y-6\\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2 } &=& 12x\\
\end{eqnarray}$$
Thus, solve $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0$ we get
$$\begin{eqnarray}
x=-1 & y=-1 & \textbf{local maximum}\\
x=0 & y=-1 & \textbf{saddle point}\\
x=0 & y=0 & \textbf{saddle point} \\
x=1 & y=0 & \textbf{local minimum}\\
\end{eqnarray}$$

And there is no global maximum and global minimum.

(c) Show that any local minimum of a convex function f on a convex set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a global minimum of $f$ on $S$. (Hint: If a local minimum $x$ is not a global minimum, then let y be a point in $S$ such that $f(y) < f(x)$ and consider the line segment between x and y to obtain a contradiction.)

Suppose there is a $y$ s.t. $f(y)<f(x)$, thus,  all the points on the line segment $g(t)$shall be 
$$
g(t) = yt+x(1-t)\ where\ t\in[0,1]
$$
So, since x is a local point, there always exists a $t_0$ small enough, $g(t_0)$ close enough to x where $f(g(t_0))>f(x)$ since x is a local minimum.
However, since function is a convex,
$$
f(g(t_0)) = f(yt_0+x(1-t_0)) \le t_0f(y)+f(x)-t_0f(x) = t_0(f(y)-f(x))+f(x)<f(x)
$$
However, we know that $f(g(t_0))<f(x)$, it leads to a contradiction. Thus, there is no y exists.


###Problem 5: (20 points)

Write a program to find a minimum of Rosenbrock’s function
$$f(x,y) = 100(y-x^2)^2+(1-x)^2$$
using each of the following methods:
(a) Steepest descent 
(b) Newton

You should try each of the methods from each of the three starting points $[-1, 1]^T$, $[0, 1]^T$, $[2, 1]^T$. Provide the returned solution (x and y), its residual, and the number of iterations for each method and starting guess. Comment on whether the returned solution is a minimum.

$$\nabla f = (400x^3+2x-400xy-2)\hat{x} + (-200x^2+200y)\hat{y}$$
$$H = \begin{bmatrix}1200x^2+2 & -400 \\ -400 & 200\end{bmatrix}$$

###Problem 6: (15 points)

A bacterial population $P$ grows according to the geometric progression

$$P_k = rP_{k-1} $$

where $r$ is the growth rate. The following population counts (in the billions) are observed:

| $k$   | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8  |
|-------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|
| $P_k$ | 0.91 | 0.36 | 0.69 | 1.3 | 2.5 | 4.7 | 8.5 | 14 |

(a) Perform a nonlinear least squares fit of the growth function to these data to estimate the initial population $P_0$ and the growth rate $r$.

(b) By taking the logarithm of the model function, a fit to these data can also be done by linear least squares. Perform such a linear least squares fit to obtain estimates for P0 and r, and compare your results with those from your nonlinear fit

Solve the difference equation, we can get a model:
$$P(k) = P_0 e^{kr}$$,

If we tried to fit the data, we get
```python
k = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], dtype=np.float)
P = np.array([0.91,0.36,0.69,1.3,2.5,4.7,8.5,14])

def F(t, p0, r):
    return p0*np.exp(t*r)

def R(t, y, p0, r):
    return y-F(t, p0, r)

def J(t ,p0, r):
    return np.array([-np.exp(r*t), -p0*t*np.exp(r*t)]).T

def GuassNewton(J, F, R, x):
    p0, r = x
    for i in range(50):
        s, _, _, _ = la.lstsq(J(k, p0, r),-R(k, P, p0, r))
        small_norm = la.norm(R(k, P, p0, r))
        p0, r = x = x+s
    return p0, r
p0, r = GuassNewton(J, F, R, np.array([0, 0]))
plt.scatter(k, P)
plt.plot(k, F(k, p0, r))
plt.show()
```
result:


If we take lg on both sides,
we have new equation: 
$$\log(P_0)+rk = \log(P(k))$$

And here is the code
```python
(log_p0, r), _, _, _ = la.lstsq(np.array([np.ones(len(k)), k]).T, np.log(P))
plt.scatter(k, P)
plt.plot(k, F(k, np.exp(p0), r))
plt.show()
```
